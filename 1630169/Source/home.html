                    <p>
                            One of the 20th century’s most celebrated motorcycle manufacturers, the original Triumph ground to a halt in the
                            early 1980s. Reborn as a thoroughly modern British company in the 1990s, the new Triumph vowed to create its own
                            identity rather than producing copycat sportbikes or cruisers. Today’s lineup of two- and three-cylinder bikes is
                            impressive, blanketing adventure, cruiser, modern classic, and the roadster/supersport categories. The
                            three-cylinder range includes the the rakish Street and Speed Triple naked bikes, the off-road-capable Tiger 800 and
                            1200, and the massive 2,294cc Rocket III cruiser with its claimed 163 pound-feet of torque at 2,750 rpm. As for its
                            twin-cylinder options, Triumphs offers the Bonneville, Scrambler, Speed and Street Twins, and Thruxton, plus the
                            Speedmaster cruiser. Altogether, the lineup beautifully honors Triumph’s rich heritage, bridging the century-wide
                            gap between the first Triumph in 1902 to the 17 very latest machines.

                        earned it a phenomenal reputation worldwide. And now, new-for-2019 enhancements add a
                        new dimension of performance, capability, comfort and style to one of Triumph’s most
                        accessible and easy-handling modern classics.<br><br>

                        With a significantly updated 900cc twin Bonneville engine for more power, higher
                        standard specification equipment, new class-leading technology, more premium detailing
                        and finish, and an even more distinctive and purposeful scrambler look, the result is a
                        new generation Street Scrambler that’s even more fun to ride than ever before.<br> </p>
